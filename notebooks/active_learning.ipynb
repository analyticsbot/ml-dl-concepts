    "#### Active Learning Algorithm\n",
    "Active learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm can query a user or an oracle to obtain labels for new data points. The goal is to achieve high performance with fewer labeled instances by strategically selecting which data points to label.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases for Active Learning\n",
    "- Image Classification: In scenarios where labeling images is expensive or time-consuming, active learning can help focus on uncertain samples to improve the model's accuracy efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing: Active learning can be applied in tasks such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition, where labeling text can be subjective and labor-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Medical Diagnosis: In medical imaging, where experts are needed to label images, active learning can help prioritize which images to review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anomaly Detection: Active learning can be used to identify and label anomalous data points that may be rare and critical for training robust models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommender Systems: In scenarios where user feedback is limited, active learning can be employed to gather relevant data points for better recommendations.\n",

    "#### Explanation of Key Parts\n",
    "- Imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The necessary libraries (sklearn for the logistic regression model and accuracy score, and numpy for numerical operations) are imported at the start.\n",
    "- Initialization (__init__ method):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - X_pool and y_pool: The pools of unlabeled data and their true labels are stored for querying.\n",
    "    - initial_size and query_size: Define how many samples to use for initial training and how many to query in each iteration, respectively.\n",
    "    - A logistic regression model is instantiated, and the initial labeled data is selected and fitted to the model. This is essential to get the first iteration started.\n",
    "- Query Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The query method calculates the probabilities of the unlabeled data. The uncertainty is assessed by determining which predictions are the least confident (i.e., probabilities close to 0.5). This is crucial for active learning because the goal is to label the most informative data points.\n",
    "- Update Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After querying, the update method adds the newly labeled data to the existing labeled dataset and retrains the model. This is important for improving the model's performance iteratively with new data.\n",
    "- Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The get_performance method measures the accuracy of the model on a separate test set. Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance after each iteration helps track its improvement.\n",
    "- Simulation Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The loop simulates the active learning process for a specified number of iterations, printing the accuracy after each iteration to monitor progress. This provides a practical demonstration of how active learning refines the model over time."

    "\n",
    "    - When labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "    - When you have a large pool of unlabeled data but only a limited budget for labeling.\n",

    "##### What is the Loss Function\n",
    "In active learning, the loss function typically depends on the model being used. For logistic regression, the loss function is usually the binary cross-entropy loss, defined as:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### How to Optimize the Algorithm\n",
    "- Model Selection: Use more advanced models that can better capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smart Query Strategies: Experiment with different query strategies (e.g., uncertainty sampling, query by committee) to find the most effective one for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Query Size: Adjust the size of the query based on the confidence of the model or the remaining pool of unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Budget Management: Monitor the labeling budget closely and prioritize data points that will give the most significant performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods: Use ensemble methods to improve the robustness of predictions and uncertainty estimates.\n",
